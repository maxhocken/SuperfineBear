Variety of code and scripts involving automating work flow in studies of cell motilty and traction force microscopy. 
Includes edits to Danuser TF code provided under GPL, matlab scripts to automate image analysis, FIJI macros to automate image massaging and initial processing.

Split into several parts; Area segmentation and automatic cell tracking based off of MATLAB's image processing toolbox, FIJI plugins specific to our image analysis pipeline, and other miscallenous scripts and code.
