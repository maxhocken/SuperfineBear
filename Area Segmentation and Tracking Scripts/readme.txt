CellMaskGenerator takes in an input folder, then passes each image inside to ImageThresholding which will segment the image. 
To use, simply paste the folder path of your desired folder. 
A number of additional options, settings, etc are included and often commented out. 
Output is cell masks and variable containing cell centroids and areas in pixels.
